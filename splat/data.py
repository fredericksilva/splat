    """A fragment of sound data

    Create an empty sound fragment with the given number of ``channels``,
    sample ``rate`` in Hertz and initial ``duration`` in seconds.  The default
    number of channels is 2 and the default sample rate is 48000.  If no
    duration is specified, the fragment will be empty.  All the samples are
    initialised to 0 (silence).

    All Splat sound data is contained in :py:class:`splat.data.Fragment`
    objects.  They are accessible as a mutable sequence of tuples of floating
    point values to represent the samples of the audio channels.  The length of
    each sample tuple is equal to the number of channels of the fragment, the
    maximum being fixed to 16.

    .. note::

       It is rather slow to access and modify all the samples of a Fragment
       using the standard Python sequence interface.  The underlying
       implementation in C can handle all common data manipulations much
       faster using the Fragment methods documented below.

        :py:class:`splat.data.Fragment` instance, which is then returned.

        The format can be specified via the ``fmt`` argument, otherwise it may
        be automatically detected if possible.  When using file-like objects,
        it is necessary to specify the format explicitly when the format could
